Hi there,

This project was designed to help the grants officers of Tilburg University in managing their eligibility lists.
Info on how to use this program will follow.

Current workflow to update the .exe:
In powershell, navigate to the eligibility_project folder. Execute command `npm run dump -r requirements.txt` 

After doing so check whether it works by running `npm run servewindows`

If that works,
